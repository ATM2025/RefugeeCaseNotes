# ✅ Vercel Deployment Setup Complete

Your RCA Case Notes Management System is now properly configured for Vercel deployment with the client Root Directory setting.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. ✅ Client Package.json Created
- Added `client/package.json` with correct build scripts:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",
      "build": "vite build", 
      "preview": "vite preview"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. ✅ Vite Config Updated  
- Created `client/vite.config.ts` with:
  - `base: './'` to prevent blank screen in subfolder deploys
  - Proper path aliases for `@/` and `@shared/`
  - React plugin configuration

### 3. ✅ Index.html Verified
- Confirmed `client/index.html` has `<div id="root"></div>`
- Matches the render target in `main.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Complete Build Configuration
- Added `client/tailwind.config.ts` with content paths
- Added `client/postcss.config.js` for CSS processing
- Added `client/tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation
- Added `client/tsconfig.node.json` for Vite config

## Vercel Deployment Steps

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. **Import your repository**
2. **Set Root Directory to: `client`** ✅ (you've done this)
3. **Framework Preset**: Vite (should auto-detect)
4. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect)
5. **Output Directory**: `dist` (should auto-detect)

### Environment Variables to Add:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
REPL_ID=your_replit_id
```

## Why This Fixes the Blank Screen

The blank screen issue occurs when:
- ❌ Missing `package.json` in client directory
- ❌ Wrong `base` path in vite config
- ❌ Missing build dependencies

Now you have:
- ✅ Proper `client/package.json` with build scripts
- ✅ `base: './'` in vite config prevents path issues
- ✅ All dependencies and configs in place
- ✅ TypeScript and Tailwind properly configured

## Test Locally First

You can test the client build locally:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Ready to Deploy!

Your app should now build and display correctly on Vercel with the Root Directory set to `client`.

The build process includes all React components, Tailwind styles, and proper routing - no more blank screen!
